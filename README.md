## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

This project goal is to use JavaScript to build a simple game. A game that is memory based and similar to the well know Simon Says game. This project has a target audience is anyone ages 6+, and those whom like to play games in their spare time.

#### Recruiters Goals

The main audience for this site is anyone aged 6+.

#### User Goals:

- To sucessfully complete the game.
- Enjoy the game.
- Challenege memory.

#### Developers goals:

- Create a simple and interactive game.
- Demonstrate the use of Javescript.
- Make an enjoyable game for users.

#### User Stories

As a user I want:

- To play a interactive game, that is also fun and enjoyable.
- To understand the instructions given.
- Increase the difficulty.
- Consistent functionalities.

As the site owner I want:

- A fun game that I and others enjoy.
- A structured and simple code
- Demonstrate what I have learnt with JavaScript.
- Clear and intruvitity within my game/site.
- A game that functions and is consistent.

## Design Choices

The design choices were decided over the development of this project. The [Wireframes](#wireframes) were a starting point. As development went on, the structure and game changed as well.

### Languages Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Fonts

- The font Teko was used for the main title and the sub title of "How to Play?"
- Poppins was used for the instructions on how to play and the footer elements.

### Icons

- For my footer elements, I used a basic icons to identify my social links. These are easy to recognise also.
- The website icon, I created it on Favicon. I created four squares, with two squares solid to represent the game.

### Colours

- I used a black background and some bold bright colours to make it more appealing to the game, I think it gives a arcade game feel.
- The colours of this project were all randomised via [Coolors](https://coolors.co/a8d5e2-f9a620-ffd449-548c2f-104911) and then selected by myself.

### Images

- Favicon Icon images can be found [Favicon](assets/images/favicon/)

### Video Files

- Link to video, used to show features [Sequence Square Game Video](assets/video/sequence-squares-game.mp4).

### Wireframes

- Wireframes was created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). The overall site has changed over development. This was due to the complexity it may have when building. As this is my first time working with JavaScript. I wanted to make something very simple and basic, due to where my skill set currently is.
- Wireframes can be found [here](assets/images/wireframes/).

## Features

- Functional footer which provides link to GitHub and my portfolio.
- Instructions collapse area, is functional and able to see how to play the game.
- Favicon used to give individuality to the site.
- Responsive for all screen sizes.
- Easy navigation and simiple to interact with.
- Identifiable buttons.
- Feedback form that allows emails to be sent in order to recieve feedback from users.

### Loaded page:

When you first load on the page you are meet with a "Start" and "Instructions" button.

![User Interface](assets/images/start-game-ux.png)

### Feedback Form:

A simple feedback form at the bottom of the page. Allowing users to provide feedback in what they would prefer, what they liked and disliked etc.
<br>![Feedback Form](assets/images/feedback-form.png)

When you have successfully sent your email over, an alert will display to show that this has been sent.
<br>![Feedback Sent](assets/images/feedback-sent.png)

### How to Play:

The instruction button when clicked, displays that instructions on how to play the game.

![How to Play?](assets/images/how-to-play.png)

### Game in Progress:

When you press start, the sequence will display. Each square will flash a light one at a time. You will have to repeat the sequence once the computer has finished displaying their sequence.

### Game over Alert:

The game over alert will display when you incorrectly select the wrong button.
<br>![Game Over](assets/images/game-over.png)

## Future Feautres

- I plan to have a ending level to cap the game once a certain level has been reached. In result, I would like to incorperate a winning celeberation on the screen for the successful users.
- Furthermore I would also like to add sound to the game, whether that is with the game buttons or putting an radio/api that alsos the user to play the game as well as listen to their favourite songs.
- As well as this I would like to make the game visibly inactive if the game has not been started or provide a start menu that will take you to the game.

## Accessibility

- Ensured that the flashlight up styling had to be transparent to ensure the everyone can see the sequence being flashed.
- Used colours that would interfer or clash with eachother, easy on the eye.

## Testing

### For this project I have had friends and family ranging from 7-56 years old, test amongst of various devices. Such as;

- Iphone 12 Pro - Safari, Portrait mode.
- Iphone 11 Pro - Safari, Portrait and Landscape mode.
- Iphone 13 - Safari, Portrait and Landscape mode.
- MacBook - Chrome.
- Iphone XR - Safari, Portrait Mode.
- Iphone 15 - Safari, Portrait Mode.
- Ipad
- Ipad
- Ipad 7th Gen - Safari, Portrait
- HP Pavillion Gaming Laptop 17 - Chrome
- Samsung S12 - Samsung Internet, Portrait mode.
- Iphone 13 - Safari, Portrait and Landscape Mode.

After collating the data from my testers, the general concensious over Sequence Squares is that it is a good functional game. All buttons and functionalities worked correctly as they should. No mention of the flow of the page, however, some suggestions were similar to my future features. Suggestions such as a countdown timer for the start of each round, starting rounds with a fewer buttons and have a success rate that will then increase the difficultiy once the user has developed some confidence and be switched on in the game. As for the sucessful or game over alerts, it was suggested to have glowing text within the page itself that will signify if there is a next level, game over or game complete. Another tester had stated that this should be an app as this is something they would play as they travelled. Although, I had a feedback form below by habit my tested messaged me back instead. However, one test did infact use the feedback form and I had recieved the follow screenshot below, in which the tester expressed the same suggestions. They had also mentioned that yellow and orange square looked somewhat similar which had them a bit confused when it came to repeating the sequence. As well having this current code as a challenge mode and have easier mode with less buttons in the standard games.

### Lighthouse - Developer Chrome Tools

Using the Google Chrome Developer tools, I had used Lighthouse within an icognito browser (due to extentison interference) to look at the overall quality of my site.
<br>
![Lighthouse Overview](assets/images/lighthouse/lighthouse-overview.png)
<br>
Although the overall quality over my site was a score of 91, the accessibility of my site could improve significantly.
<br>
![Lighthouse Accessibility](assets/images/lighthouse/lighthouse-accessibility.png)
<br>
I have recognised that some elements (Square buttons) were missing Aria attributes within them. I rectofied this by adding aria-label to my div buttons to improve this. As well as this, background and foreground colors do not have suffiecent contrast ratio.

I had few diagnostics within the lighthouse section that could be improved.
<br>
![Lighthouse Diagnostics](assets/images/lighthouse/lighthouse-diagnostics.png)
<br>
Overall I understand how to resolve a few of them. However currently, "Serve static assets with an efficent cache policy", "Avoid serving legacy JavaScript to modern browers" and "Eliminate render-blocking resources" are things im not to sure how to resolve. I have read in to these diagnostics and have tried to improve on things that was within my capacity. Such as the contrasting with the slogan "Square Up" it was previously a yellow glow, though changing to a red/pink has removed this issue.

Once I made all the changes, I retested my site in Lighthouse. I had better results:

### Validators

W3c was used to validate HTML and CSS code.

HTML Validator:
![HTML Validator Overview Part 1](assets/images/validators/html-validator-error-button.png)
![HTML Validator Overview Part 2](assets/images/validators/html-validator-error-paragraph.png)
![HTML Validator Overview Part 3](assets/images/validators/html-validator-warning-javatype.png)
![HTML Validator Overview Part 4](assets/images/validators/html-validator-info.png)

Overall, I needed to neaten up my html by removing some attrtubutes (for attrbute within the submit button element and type within the script elements in the head). I also changed the paragraph element within the list element of how to play, as this was not allowed to - these were changed to a list item. I have noticed the info text, I had removed the "/" from the closing tags, due to the autosave extension I have the slash is automtically returned to the end of the self-closing element. This doesn't interfere with the web itself. However moving forward I will remove this extension to reduce the feedback within this validator. Once I had made the changes to the errors/warnings, I had a successful pass with no warnings and errors. (Though the info for the ending tags with the "/" still appeared as expected.)
![HTML Validator - Pass](assets/images/validators/html-validator-no-error.png)

CSS Validator:
![CSS Validator](assets/images/validators/css-validator.png)

There were nothing to report back or fix within my css as far as the validator is concencerned.

## Bugs

- When hovering over the squares within the grid, squares would move. I found that this could be caused due to the child elements not being "fixed" within the parent div. I used box-sizing: border-box to resolve my issue for now.
- Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerText') - showScore (script.js:31:46), newGame (script.js:19:3), HTMLButtonElement.onclick ((index):18:55). It seemed I had a typo when getting my element within the showTurns function.
- Undefined data result when checking current game in dev tools. Checked data attributes within my html div square classes and changed them to data-id, this allowed me to pull the correct data within the script.js file.
- Sequence started immediately on page load, due to sequence function being called at the very start. I had removed this function from the pure game start.
- Sequence didn't increase, it used all 9 buttons within one sequence, calling them one after another. However, It wouldn't increment. This was because I hadnt called the sequnence and combined it with "++".
- New game would be called everytime, even when user was successful in copying sequence. I had mixed up a lot of the game logic. I had to restructer and go through the copy and remove some called functions.
- EmailJS function work when email has been sent. When testing in the development or deployed area, it seems that there is a limit of how many emails are sent out.
- (Not much of a bug)The original 9 buttons had been reduced to 6. As I wasnt sure how to increase difficulty once a user was successful due to how I incremeneted the sequence. I had removed 3 buttons and tried this game with 6 buttons and it naturally increases the difficulty.
