## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals
This project goal is to use JavaScript to build a simple game. A game that is memory based and similar to the well know Simon Says game. This project has a target audience is anyone ages 6+, and those whom like to play games in their spare time.

#### Recruiters Goals

The main audience for this site is anyone aged 6+.

#### User Goals:
- To sucessfully complete the game.
- Enjoy the game.
- Challenege memory.

#### Developers goals:
- Create a simple and interactive game.
- Demonstrate the use of Javescript.
- Make an enjoyable game for users.

#### User Stories

As a user I want:
- To play a interactive game, that is also fun and enjoyable.
- To understand the instructions given.
- Increase the difficulty.
- Consistent functionalities.

As the site owner I want:
- A fun game that I and others enjoy.
- A structured and simple code
- Demonstrate what I have learnt with JavaScript.
- Clear and intruvitity within my game/site.
- A game that functions and is consistent.


## Design Choices
The design choices were decided over the development of this project. The [Wireframes](#wireframes) were a starting point. As development went on, the structure and game changed as well.

### Languages Used 

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Fonts
- The font Teko was used for the main title and the sub title of "How to Play?"
- Poppins was used for the instructions on how to play and the footer elements.


### Icons 
- For my footer elements, I used a basic icons to identify my social links. These are easy to recognise also.
- The website icon, I created it on Favicon. I created four squares, with two squares solid to represent the game.  

### Colours
- I used a black background and some bold bright colours to make it more appealing to the game, I think it gives a arcade game feel.
- The colours of this project were all randomised via [Coolors](https://coolors.co/a8d5e2-f9a620-ffd449-548c2f-104911) and then selected by myself. 

### Images
- Favicon Icon image can be found [Favicon](favicon.ico)

### Video Files
 - Link to video, used to show features [Sequence Square Game Video](assets/video/sequence-squares-game.mp4).


### Wireframes
- Wireframes was created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). The overall site has changed over development. This was due to the complexity it may have when building. As this is my first time working with JavaScript. I wanted to make something very simple and basic, due to where my skill set currently is.
- Wireframes can be found [here](assets/images/wireframes/).

## Features
- Functional footer which provides link to GitHub and my portfolio.
- Instructions collapse area, is functional and able to see how to play the game.
- Favicon used to give individuality to the site.
- Responsive for all screen sizes.
- Easy navigation and simiple to interact with.
- Identifiable buttons.
- Feedback form that allows emails to be sent in order to recieve feedback from users.

### Loaded page: 
When you first load on the page you are meet with a "Start" and "Instructions" button.

### Feedback Form:
A simple feedback form at the bottom of the page. Allowing users to provide feedback in what they would prefer, what they liked and disliked etc.
<br>![Feedback Form](assets/images/feedback-form.png)

When you have successfully sent your email over, an alert will display to show that this has been sent.

### How to Play:
The instruction button when clicked, displays that instructions on how to play the game.

### Game in Progress:
When you press start, the sequence will display. Each square will flash a light one at a time. You will have to repeat the sequence once the computer has finished displaying their sequence.

### Correct Sequence Alert:
If you match the sequence correctly an alert will display before the next round.

### Game over Alert:
The game over alert will display when you incorrectly select the wrong button.
![Game Over](assets/images/game-over.png)

### Accessibility
- Ensured that the flashlight up styling had to be transparent to ensure the everyone can see the sequence being flashed.
- Used colours that would interfer or clash with eachother, easy on the eye. 

## Testing
For this project I have had friends and family ranging from 7-56 years old, test amongst of various devices. Such as;

## Bugs
- When hovering over the squares within the grid, squares would move. I found that this could be caused due to the child elements not being "fixed" within the parent div. I used box-sizing: border-box to resolve my issue for now.
- Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerText') - showScore (script.js:31:46), newGame (script.js:19:3), HTMLButtonElement.onclick ((index):18:55). It seemed I had a typo when getting my element within the showTurns function.
- Undefined data result when checking current game in dev tools. Checked data attributes within my html div square classes and changed them to data-id, this allowed me to pull the correct data within the script.js file.
- Sequence started immediately on page load, due to sequence function being called at the very start. I had removed this function from the pure game start.
- Sequence didn't increase, it used all 9 buttons within one sequence, calling them one after another. However, It wouldn't increment. This was because I hadnt called the sequnence and combined it with "++".
- New game would be called everytime, even when user was successful in copying sequence. I had mixed up a lot of the game logic. I had to restructer and go through the copy and remove some called functions.
- EmailJS function work when email has been sent. Though the test email is not sending over. Could this be due to the undeployment of the site?
- (Not much of a bug)The original 9 buttons had been reduced to 6. As I wasnt sure how to increase difficulty once a user was successful due to how I incremeneted the sequence. I had removed 3 buttons and tried this game with 6 buttons and it naturally increases the difficulty.
